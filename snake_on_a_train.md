🐍 on a 🚆

The 📖 you are about to read, is one filled with adventure, magic, 💕, and 🍕. It all started about 10 years ago, in a 🏰 in the middle of the 🇫🇷 🗻 . The only way to get to the 🏰 was to take the very shaky 🚞 up the 🗻. The proprietor of the 🏰 was a little eccentric, and 💕 to cause trouble for the towns folk at the base of the 🗻. His name was Fredrick Kelmbockum III. Fredrick lived alone, he didn't really like people. If he didn't have to make his semi weekly trip ⬇️ the 🗻 on the rickety 🚞 to get 🍕 and 🍸, he would be content staying put in his large 🏰.
