🐍 on a 🚆

The 📖 you are about to read, is one filled with adventure, magic, 💕, and 🍕. It all started about 10 years ago, in a 🏰 in the middle of the 🇫🇷 🗻 . The only way to get to the 🏰 was to take the very shaky 🚞 up the 🗻. The proprietor of the 🏰 was a little eccentric, and 💕 to cause trouble for the towns folk at the base of the 🗻. His name was Fredrick Kelmbockum III. Fredrick lived alone, he didn't really like people. If he didn't have to make his semi weekly trip ⬇️ the 🗻 on the rickety 🚞 to get 🍕 and 🍸, he would be content staying put in his large 🏰.

It was a gloomy 🌁 🌅, and Fredrick was getting ready to make his journey ⬇️ the 🗻 to gather supplies for the impending ❄️ storm heading for his 🏰 on the 🗻.  What he didn't realize was that this was not going to be like any other trip ⬇️ the 🗻. For you see, Fredrick was 🚫 the only one with a journey at ✋. Way on the other end of the little village of Franzkofkin a group of gnomes were planning to treck up the 🗻 to seek shelter in what they thought was an abandoned 🏰. The gnomes had very little knowledge of modern day technology such as 💻, 🚗, and 🚆. Because of this, they had planned for weeks their 5 day journey up the 🗻.

As Fredrick sat waiting for the 🚞, he started going through his list of things he needed to acquire. "Hmmm, let's see, I need to pick up 🍕, 🍸, 📰, and one gently used 🌂" he 💬. As he was staring off into the distance, he noticed a small structure ⬆️ a small hill not too far from the 🚉. "What is that?" he 💭. "I am the only one that lives on this 🗻, they are disrupting the flow of things." All of a sudden, a very small 👨 popped up from the small structure and proceeded to evaluate the structure to make sure it was sturdy.

Fredrick was startled when he saw the small 👨. He got ⬆️ from his very uncomfortable bench he always loved sitting on, and started walking towards the small structure. Before he could cross the 🚋 tracks, he saw the 🚞 coming and realized he didn't have time. "What ever it is looks like it is here to stay, I will have to deal with this when I get back up the 🗻." he 💬 to himself.
