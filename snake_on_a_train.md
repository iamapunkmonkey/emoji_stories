🐍 on a 🚆

The 📖 you are about to read, is one filled with adventure, magic, 💕, and 🍕. It all started about 10 years ago, in a 🏰 in the middle of the 🇫🇷 🗻 . The only way to get to the 🏰 was to take the very shaky 🚞 up the 🗻. The proprietor of the 🏰 was a little eccentric, and 💕 to cause trouble for the towns folk at the base of the 🗻. His name was Fredrick Kelmbockum III. Fredrick lived alone, he didn't really like people. If he didn't have to make his semi weekly trip ⬇️ the 🗻 on the rickety 🚞 to get 🍕 and 🍸, he would be content staying put in his large 🏰.

It was a gloomy 🌁 🌅, and Fredrick was getting ready to make his journey ⬇️ the 🗻 to gather supplies for the impending ❄️ storm heading for his 🏰 on the 🗻.  What he didn't realize was that this was not going to be like any other trip ⬇️ the 🗻. For you see, Fredrick was 🚫 the only one with a journey at ✋. Way on the other end of the little village of Franzkofkin a group of gnomes were planning to treck up the 🗻 to seek shelter in what they thought was an abandoned 🏰. The gnomes had very little knowledge of modern day technology such as 💻, 🚗, and 🚆. Because of this, they had planned for weeks their 5 day journey up the 🗻.
